## NTE concept: third revision

```javascript
var app = {
    
    name: "myApp",

    model: { 
        fname: "Mario", 
        lname: "Rossi", 
        fullname: (fname,lname) => fname + ' ' + lname
    },

    view: {
        fname: input(),
        lname: input(),
        fullname: p(),
        save: button("send")
    },

    controller: {
        sync: {
            init: function() {
                debugger;
                this.fullname.NTE.updateEveryKeyPress = true
            }
        },
        async: {
            save: function() {
                send();
            }
        }
    }
} // app

var myApp = NTE.createApp( app, NTE.layouts.verticalForm )
```

[Demo](https://zonafets.github.io/NTE/src/mvc-nte.html).

NTE bind model to the view matching the names of members.

Then bind computed functions matching member names of view with parameters of members that are functions. Other kind of functions are not allowed.

A parser that works server side can optimize this process and generate intermediate code as: 

```javascript
// code generated by a server side parser 
function app_controller_init(app) {
    var rtrn = app.controller.init.bind(app.view)()
    if (app.view.fullname.NTE.updateEveryKeyPress) {
        console.log("updateEveryKeyPress change, addListener...")
    }
}
```

This would produce a light application as was written by hand, reducing overheads as in typical frameworks.

The goals is also to facilitate the development using a two side collaboration system with a client-side console equipped with smart and small editors added as plug-ins. Something as:

```
>mode edit A54B23GW13
-edit key accepted

>create app myApp
-skeleton generated

>add fname "Mario" as input(label:"First Name",placeholder:"your name") 
-model member "fname" added and control shown

>sync
-created server service "myApp"
-create server table "myApp"

>create widget WeekDays
```
